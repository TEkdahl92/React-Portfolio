              <p>Full Stack web developer using my background in customer service to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the
University of Texas at Austin, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. Known as a fun and innovative problem solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user experience. I applied my knowledge of 
the MERN stack development in a recent project. I worked on a team of five to develop a multi-page MERN app that provides users with a more fun and enjoyable experience while searching for their favorite books or if they want to join a book club. Iâ€™m excited to
leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the
web.  </p>
